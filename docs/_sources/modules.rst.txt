Modules description
========
The three stages of the code can be run separately in the :ref:`binary`, :ref:`consolidation` and
:ref:`predict`, or are packaged up to run in that order in the :ref:`main`. The :ref:`config` contains a class
that holds the configuration variables used throughout the code. The :ref:`helper` contains
a class that holds the functions used throughout the code. The code is available publicly `here <https://github.com/SFotopoulou/classification_ec>`_ **TO CHANGE**
A README file is also provided in that github repo, which provides setup instructions, and
more detail on running the code itself.
